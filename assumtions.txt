Contracts dataset is necessary for filtering transactions, so we write in the final dataset only those, which contracts exist in both source datasets.
Data types of source datasets are changed according to the provided example.
Parquet is chosen as a most performant and cost-effective target format.

In order to handle new batches of data without overriding previous batches I'd recommned to put them in different folders with hierarchical structure like <YYYY-MM-DD>/<YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM>
